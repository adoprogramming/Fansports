Fantasy Football Web Application

This is was my senior project. It was completed over a semester with the collaboration of two other students.  It is a simple Fantasy Footabll Web Application. The application is designed to allow users to register and sign in to an account. Once signed in, the user can create a fantasy football league or join a fantasy football league. Each league is comprised of two users. Each user goes through a turn based draft to select their players. The players and their stats are pulled from a third party application that creates a postgres database from NFL.com information. Only the quick match is available in this version. The quick match decides a winner by taking the average points of each team's individual players, and slightly randomizing sum. The winner is the user whose team has the most overall points.
