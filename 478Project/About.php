<div class = "aboutInfo">
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We here at FanSports are a small team of UIS computer science students that came together to create this application as a result of Professor Roger Westâ€™s Software Engineering course project assignment. Each of us live in separate regions of the country and have never formally met so this project came together remotely using various web-based tools for group communication and file sharing. The impetus behind the Fansports application was two-fold. First, being a fantasy sports application we clearly wanted it to be entertaining and secondly, we also wanted FanSports to be an educational resource for other developers hence the open source nature of the application.</p>
  <p>We very much hope that you enjoy your visit to our site!
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FanSports Team (Ann, Wes, and Jeremy)
